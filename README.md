# GPT-Text-Detection-Project

Project done during the 2021 Hamilton Internship in TCD.

The aim of the project was to see in which contexts and under what conditions GPT-2 generated text could be distinguished from human text. A BERT classifier was compared with a baseline of Logistic Regression on word embeddings. A poster summarising findings can be seen below.
